                    <p>
                        As a Full-Stack Web Developer, my goal is to utilize my skills to help Businesses, both large and small, develop a web-presence that will increase visibility and profits, meet or exceed current standards and keep up with future trends.  In this society, a "Strong Web Presence" is essential to a business.  Organizational and Communications skills are, also, of key importance for success.

                        In 1980, I started working with computers, which required a certain amount of technical skill to accomplish anything. I enjoy technology, design, teaching, coaching, and learning new skills.  Having worked in a variety of industries, and being a small business owner myself, I feel that I can connect with most businesses and have a working knowledge to understand, discuss, and help meet their needs.  I hope to work with you soon to further your business goals.

                    Most of my personal time is spent with my husband and two fur-babies (dogs).  We also enjoy time with close and extended family.  My interests include: computers (of course), photography, music - instrumental and vocal, martial arts, travel, outdoor and marksmanship activities.
